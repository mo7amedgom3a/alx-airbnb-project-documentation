# Airbnb Clone Backend â€“ Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

# ðŸ“Œ Introduction

### Purpose

This document outlines the software requirements for the backend of the Airbnb Clone web application. It defines the core functionalities, technical implementation details, and non-functional aspects required to build a robust, secure, and scalable backend system.

### Scope

The backend will handle server-side logic, database operations, and API integrations for user management, property listings, bookings, payments, notifications, and administration. It will expose RESTful APIs for frontend consumption.

### Intended Audience

- Backend Developers
- Frontend Developers
- QA Engineers
- DevOps Engineers
- Project Managers

### Definitions and Acronyms

- **JWT**: JSON Web Token
- **RBAC**: Role-Based Access Control
- **API**: Application Programming Interface
- **REST**: Representational State Transfer
- **OAuth**: Open Authorization
